# Executive Order Search

![Executive order search app](https://www.ctl.io/developers/assets/images/blog/orchestrate-executive-orders.png)

This application allows you to search within every executive order between 1993 and 2014. Then you'll see a tally of the number of executive orders that match your search for each of the three US presidents during that 21 years.

A demo is [running on Heroku](http://exor.herokuapp.com/)

More behind the application is available in the [original blog post](https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/open-data-import-enables-us-executive-order-search) as well as [another that helps with data import](https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/as-a-service-flexibility).
